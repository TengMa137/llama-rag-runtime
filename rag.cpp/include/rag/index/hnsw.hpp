// rag/index/hnsw.hpp — Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximate NN index.
//
// Malkov & Yashunin (2016). O(log n) vector search via a layered proximity
// graph: greedy descent through sparse upper layers to land near the target,
// then a beam (ef) search on the dense base layer. This is the algorithm
// behind FAISS-HNSW / hnswlib / every modern vector DB, in pure C++/STL.
//
// Extras that keep it SOTA:
//   • Matryoshka truncation — score on a truncated prefix of each vector
//     (MRL embeddings keep the most information in the leading dims), then
//     rescore survivors on the full vector. Big speedup, negligible recall loss.
//   • Binary quantization — a 1-bit sign code per dim; the graph WALK compares
//     packed codes with Hamming/popcount (32× cheaper hop), and only the final
//     candidates are rescored with the float dot product.
//   • Serialization — adjacency lists + normalized vectors persist to a blob;
//     re-opening a corpus does not rebuild the graph.
