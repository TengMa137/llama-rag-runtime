// rag/index/corpus.hpp — the concrete store: documents, chunks, BM25 + HNSW,
// hybrid search, incremental update, and persistence.

// The Corpus owns the ground truth (chunks + their embeddings) and both
// indexes built over it. It is the substrate the high-level Engine and the
// pipeline stages operate on. Embedding is optional and lazy: without an
// Embedder the Corpus is a first-class BM25 lexical store; with one it becomes
// a hybrid store and (past a size threshold) builds an HNSW graph.
