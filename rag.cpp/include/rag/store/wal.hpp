// rag/store/wal.hpp — write-ahead log: make a mutation durable in O(record),
// not O(corpus).
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
//
// A server that accepts writes has to choose between two bad options if a full
// snapshot is its only durability mechanism:
//
//   * save() after every mutation. Correct, but it rewrites the WHOLE index for
//     one new document. Measured: an acknowledged index/add costs 25 ms on a
//     20k-document corpus and 69.7 ms on 50k, of which the actual insert is
//     0.007 ms. The cost is entirely the rewrite, and it grows without bound.
//   * save() occasionally. Fast, but every write since the last snapshot is
//     lost on a crash — and the client was told those writes succeeded.
//
// A log removes the choice. The mutation is appended as a small record and
// synced; the snapshot happens later, on its own schedule. Measured floor for
// one durable append on this machine:
//
//   record     write only     fsync    F_FULLFSYNC
//   256 B         0.0018     0.0211         3.7686
//   4 KB          0.0077     0.0418         4.2954
//   64 KB         0.0238     0.0718         4.7803
//
// So an fsync'd append is ~600x cheaper than the 25 ms snapshot it replaces,
// and — the part that actually matters — it is CONSTANT in corpus size.
//
// DURABILITY LEVELS, and why macOS forces the question
//
// `fsync()` on macOS does NOT flush the drive's own write cache; it only pushes
// data to the device and returns. Apple documents F_FULLFSYNC as the operation
// that actually makes data survive power loss. That is a 100x difference here
// (0.04 ms vs 4.3 ms), far too large to hide behind a single "durable" flag, so
// the level is explicit and the docs say what each one actually survives.
//
// WHAT A RECORD IS
//
// Logical, not physical: "document added with this uri/text/metadata", not
// "these bytes changed at this offset". A logical log replays through the same
// Corpus API that produced it, so it cannot desynchronize from the in-memory
// structures the way a byte-diff of a half-built HNSW graph would. It also
// stays small — a document, not a re-linked graph.
